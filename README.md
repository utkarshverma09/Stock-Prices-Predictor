# Stock-Prices-Predictor
This Stock Price Predictor uses a linear regression model to predict stock prices 15 days in the future. I have extracted data from Quandl, which is a economic and financial dataset provider. I have used their WIKI service which offers data of stock prices of more than 3000 US companies. Although in 2018, WIKI was replaced by Alpha Vantage which offers a more premium and paid service for the same purpose. Because of this, the data that I have used is only upto 2018. I have used various python libraries, which include numpy, pandas, quandl, matplotlib and scikit learn, for this project.
